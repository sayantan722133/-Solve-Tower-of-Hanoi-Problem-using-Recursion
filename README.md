# -Solve-Tower-of-Hanoi-Problem-using-Recursion
This C Program uses recursive function & solves the tower of hanoi.
The tower of hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of threerods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slideonto any rod.
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. We have to obtain the same stack on the third rod.
Tower of Hanoi puzzle with n disks can be solved in minimum 2nâˆ’1 steps.
Rules:
1.Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
2.Only the "top" disk can be removed.
3.No large disk can sit over a small disk.
test case:
Enter the number of disks : 3
The sequence of moves involved in the Tower of Hanoi are :
 
Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C
Move disk 2 from peg A to peg B
Move disk 1 from peg C to peg B
Move disk 3 from peg A to peg C
Move disk 1 from peg B to peg A
Move disk 2 from peg B to peg C
Move disk 1 from peg A to peg C
